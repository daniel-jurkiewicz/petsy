## Technology

-   React (with React Router and CSS Modules)
-   NPM Packages (Calendar and Slider components)
-   Firebase

## Methodology

The application was designed and developed from scratch during the final two weeks of infoShare Academy front-end bootcamp, divided into two one-week-long Sprints using the Scrum methodology and Jira project management tool.

Our MVP (Minimal Viable Product) included service browsing with interactive search bar working across various filters and categories, reservation and reservation management capabilities for registered users, and the ability to rate and post comments by registered users, all of which were to be delivered in a visually pleasing and inviting form.

We have effectively achieved our MVP while performing daily stand-ups with relevant updates on our individual and collective progress.

### Reservations

In order to effectively achieve our MVP, we have decided to utilize the React Calendar component.

Any reservations made by a registered user can be managed via their reservation list page.
